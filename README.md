HEART ATTACK PREDICTION IMPLEMENTING KNN ON CLEANED DATA FOR BEGGINERS

This work aims to be precise and understandable work for begginers who wish to implement KNN on a clean data set.
The comments in the code explains the process step by step

💡 Project Highlights:
✅ Dataset: Data set is taken from kaggle, which is uploaded as "heart_attack.csv"
link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility
✅ Algorithm Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
✅ Optimal k Selection: k=11 using cross-validation
✅ Data Scaling: Applied StandardScaler for better KNN performance
✅ Model Evaluation:

Accuracy Score: 81.31%
Confusion Matrix: Displayed results for TP, TN, FP, and FN (refer file: confusion_matrix and accuracy_score)
Graphical Representation: Used Matplotlib to visualize the confusion matrix
Classification Report: Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score

TAKE AWAYS: 
🔹 Choosing the right 𝑘 is crucial—too small leads to overfitting, too large leads to underfitting.
🔹 Feature scaling improves KNN performance by ensuring fair distance calculations.
🔹 Cross-validation helps optimize hyperparameters and improve generalization.
