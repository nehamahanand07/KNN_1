HEART ATTACK PREDICTION IMPLEMENTING KNN ON CLEANED DATA FOR BEGGINERS

This work aims to be precise and understandable work for begginers who wish to implement KNN on a clean data set.
The comments in the code explains the process step by step

PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:
‚úÖ Dataset: Data set is taken from kaggle, which is uploaded as "heart_attack.csv"
link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility
‚úÖ Algorithm Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
‚úÖ Optimal k Selection: k=11 using cross-validation
‚úÖ Data Scaling: Applied StandardScaler for better KNN performance
‚úÖ Model Evaluation:

Accuracy Score: 81.31%
Confusion Matrix: Displayed results for TP, TN, FP, and FN (refer file: confusion_matrix and accuracy_score)
Graphical Representation: Used Matplotlib to visualize the confusion matrix
Classification Report: Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score

TAKE AWAYS: 
üîπ Choosing the right ùëò is crucial‚Äîtoo small leads to overfitting, too large leads to underfitting.
üîπ Feature scaling improves KNN performance by ensuring fair distance calculations.
üîπ Cross-validation helps optimize hyperparameters and improve generalization.


Performance Metrics:
‚úî Accuracy: 83.1%
‚úî Precision: Class 0: 91%, Class 1: 76%
‚úî Recall: Class 0: 68%, Class 1: 94%
‚úî F1-Score: Class 0: 78%, Class 1: 84%

OBSERVATIONS:

The model performed well in predicting heart attack risk (Class 1) with 94% recall, making it useful for early detection.
Precision trade-off: While Class 1 recall is high, Class 0 precision (91%) suggests the model is slightly biased toward predicting heart attack cases.
The confusion matrix visualization highlighted the balance between false positives and false negatives.

NEXT STEPS:
‚úÖ Fine-tuning hyperparameters for even better performance.
‚úÖ Exploring other ML models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) for comparison.
‚úÖ Handling class imbalance techniques to improve Class 0 recall.
